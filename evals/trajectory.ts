Evaluations are made up of three components:

1. A **dataset test** with inputs and expected outputs.
2. An **application or target function** that defines what you are evaluating, taking in inputs and returning the application output
3. **Evaluators** that score your target function's outputs.

Final Response Evaluations

One way to evaluate an agent is to assess its overall performance on a task. 
This basically involves treating the agent as a black box and 
simply evaluating whether or not it gets the job done.

- Input: User input 
- Output: The agent's final response.
